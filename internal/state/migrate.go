// Schema versioning.
//
// The file carries its version so that a future release can migrate rather than
// guess. Two rules make that work:
//
//   - a version below CurrentVersion is upgraded in memory by the chain in
//     migrations, and written back at CurrentVersion on the next Save,
//   - a version above CurrentVersion is refused. This build cannot know which
//     fields a newer release added, so loading it would work and the next Save
//     would silently drop them. Refusing turns a data-loss bug into a message
//     telling the user to update.
//
// Version 0 means "written before the version field existed": a JSON object
// with no version key unmarshals to 0. No release has shipped a v0 file, so
// migrateV0ToV1 is written against that shape rather than against history.

// migrations[v] upgrades a State in place from schema version v to v+1. A gap
// in this map for any version below CurrentVersion is a programming error, and
// migrate reports it as one rather than proceeding.

// promise in design sections 6 and 7. The migration makes the safe position

// renamed and no field is dropped, so a v1 file loads with everything in it
// intact and one field added. The reverse is refused by design: a v2 file read
// by a v1 build raises ErrFutureVersion, which tells the user to update rather
// than silently dropping the field on the next Save.
//
// Like migrateV0ToV1 it fills only what is absent, because a value already in
