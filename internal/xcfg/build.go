// # Why "network" is spelled out
//
// DNS is mostly UDP, and an absent network here means TCP ONLY, not "any":
// DokodemoConfig.Build calls v.Network.Build() at infra/conf/dokodemo.go:31,
// and NetworkList.Build returns []net.Network{net.Network_TCP} for a nil
// receiver (infra/conf/common.go:110-112). A listener without this line would
// accept the TCP retry and silently ignore every ordinary UDP query.
//
// # Why the destination is the first resolver
//
// The dokodemo proxy has to stamp SOME destination, and the routing rule for
// this inbound matches on inboundTag, so the value never decides where the
// query goes. It still matters, for two reasons.
//
// First, it is what the dns outbound falls back to. proxy/dns/dns.go:115-124
// keeps ob.Target as the dial target and overrides it only with fields the
// dns outbound's own settings set; this package sets none of them, so the
// stamped destination survives. That target is reached at :229 for any query
// the built-in resolver did not answer.
//
// Second, and this is what closes it: parseIPQuery at proxy/dns/dns.go:80-102
// returns true only for A and AAAA, and :210-213 answers those from the
// built-in resolver without dialing anything. Everything else hits the
// nonIPQuery branch, and this package emits "reject" (:219-226), which replies
// with an error rather than forwarding. So the dial at :229-231 is
// UNREACHABLE as configured. Using the operator's first resolver rather than
// an arbitrary placeholder means that if a later edit sets nonIPQuery to
// "skip" and opens that path, it opens onto an address the operator chose and
// that checkResolvers has already refused to let be a Google address.
