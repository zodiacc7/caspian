	// that ignores the address DHCP gave it and talks to a hardcoded resolver
	// is then answered by the box instead of reaching that resolver.
	//
	// # Why it is OFF by default, and what that costs
	//
	// docs/2026-08-29-design.md section 6 wants client DNS answered on the box
	// and hardcoded resolvers redirected, and it is explicit that the
	// mechanisms for that are dnsmasq and the firewall, which are
	// internal/hotspot's and internal/netcfg's. Turning this on puts a second
	// mechanism on the same traffic, and two mechanisms disagreeing about DNS
	// is worse than one. It is offered rather than assumed, and which layer
	// owns the job is the maintainer's decision, not this package's.
	//
	// # The consequence of leaving it off, stated plainly
	//
	// With BOTH this and LocalDNS.Enabled unset, nothing in the generated
	// document consults the built-in DNS app. That is a claim about every path
	// in, so here they are:
	//
	//   - The router asks the DNS client only when its domainStrategy is
	//     IpOnDemand or IpIfNonMatch (app/router/router.go:253 and :263).
	//     This package emits AsIs, which is neither.
	//   - The freedom outbound resolves only when its domainStrategy is
	//     something other than AsIs (infra/conf/freedom.go:49-51). This
	//     package emits AsIs explicitly on the direct outbound.
	//   - The "dns" outbound is the third path. TWO fields add it: this one,
	//     and LocalDNS.Enabled. Either is sufficient.
	//   - The fakedns sniffer is the fourth, and this package emits no
	//     sniffing section at all.
	//
	// The condition is BOTH, not this field alone. An earlier version of this
	// comment said "with Intercept unset" because the loopback listener did
	// not exist yet; leaving that wording after the listener was added would
	// have made it the inverse of shipped behaviour for every configuration
	// that turns the listener on.
	//
	// So with both unset the "dns" block is a stated policy that nothing
	// executes: it is what the panel's advanced mode shows and what the
	// operator's choice is recorded in, and it starts doing work the moment
	// either field is set. TestDNSAppIsUnreachableWithoutIntercept asserts the
	// four paths above stay closed when neither is set.
