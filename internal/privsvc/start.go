	// theoretical: MEASURED on the target on 2026-08-30, the service reported
	// running with hotspot=wlan0 while wlan0 was type managed, still joined to
	// the house network on the station's channel, and still holding its
	// station address. dnsmasq bound to it anyway and answered a real device
	// on that LAN with "DHCPNAK(wlan0) ... wrong server-ID", which is this
	// appliance disrupting a network it does not own.
	//
	// It is here, next to the steps it verifies, rather than immediately
	// before the access point starts, for two reasons. It is the readback OF
	// those steps and belongs with them. And a box that cannot prove the
	// interface is its own must stop before the engine dials the user's
	// server, not after.
	//
	// What runs between this line and the access point starting, checked
	// rather than assumed: the engine, whose two inbounds internal/xcfg pins
	// to loopback IP literals (checkLoopbackListen) and whose TUN inbound
	// creates the tunnel device; and PostEngineSteps, which adds a route
	// through the hotspot interface into the tunnel table. A route through an
	// interface is neither a server bound to it nor a release of it, so
	// nothing in that window changes the answer this check just read or acts
	// on it.
	//
	// It also cannot be moved LATER. Once hostapd is beaconing, "iw dev"
	// reports an SSID for the interface, netcfg's WirelessIface.InUse is true
	// for an access point that is broadcasting one, and this check would then
	// refuse every working box. The guard is
	// TestTheReleaseIsReadBackBeforeAnythingBindsAndTheAccessPointAfter, which

// applyPreEngine applies the pre-engine steps, falling back to a hotspot
// takeover when the radio refuses to create the access point's own interface.
//
// # Why this is a runtime fallback and not a planner rule
//
// A radio's interface-combination table states what the hardware could do in
// principle. It is not proof that creating the interface succeeds. MEASURED on
// the target on 2026-08-30: phy0 advertises a combination allowing an access
// point beside the station link, and "iw phy phy0 interface add ap0 type __ap"
// returns "Input/output error (-5)" while wlan0 is associated. The planner
// reads the table correctly and the driver refuses anyway, so nothing short of
// trying settles it. internal/netcfg/doc.go, "When the radio refuses what it
// advertises", records the same finding from its side.
//
// Creating a second interface stays the FIRST choice, because when it works it
// costs the user nothing: the WiFi connection that interface's radio already
// holds keeps running. The fallback is only reached after the first choice has
// actually been tried and refused.
//
// # Why the teardown between the two is not optional
//
// Both plans touch the same firewall, the same kernel knobs and the same
// hotspot address, and the second names a different interface. Applying the
// fallback on top of a half-applied first plan would leave the journal
// describing a machine that never existed, and a later teardown would then try
// to undo an address on an interface that never held it.
//
// # What the fallback costs, and why it is said out loud
//
// Taking over an interface ends whatever WiFi connection it currently holds.
// internal/netcfg puts that sentence in the plan's notes and this passes it to
// Service.note, which puts it in the log and in the advanced view. Somebody
// whose other WiFi connection drops is otherwise left guessing.
//
// It is never the uplink: internal/netcfg refuses in words a person can act on
// when the only candidate is the interface carrying the internet, and that
// refusal is passed through rather than reinterpreted here.
// # Why the takeover decision is made from a fresh reading of the machine
//
// internal/netcfg's Plan.HotspotTakeover refuses unless it can prove the
// interface is takeable, and it asks that of a netcfg.Facts. The facts this
// function was given describe the machine as it was BEFORE the first plan was
// applied and undone, which is the wrong moment: what has to be true is that
// the interface is takeable NOW. The two can differ without anything in this
// package doing it, because NetworkManager is still running: the radio can
// roam to another network, or pick up a different address, between the two
// points.
//
// The cost is one detection, five read-only commands, on a path that is
// already the slow one. The reading is taken after the first plan's teardown
// has succeeded, which is what makes the kernel knobs in it the values the
// first plan started from rather than the values it left behind.
//
// "Has succeeded" is now enforced rather than assumed. Until 2026-08-30 this
// paragraph ended "a teardown that failed returns above and never reaches
// here", and the guard it named tested only Teardown's error, which is never
// set by a failed inverse. So a teardown that undid nothing carried straight
// on. The blast radius was bounded, because the journal is a stack and the
// older entry holding the ORIGINAL value is replayed last, but "the wrong
// value gets corrected later, provided a replay eventually succeeds" is not a
// sentence this package should rest on.
