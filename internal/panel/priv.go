// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The privilege boundary.
//
// The panel process holds no privilege (docs/2026-08-29-design.md section 5.5,
// docs/LAYOUT.md "Two processes, one binary"). It runs as the caspian user and
// asks a service running as root, over a unix socket at /run/caspian/priv.sock,
// to do the things that need root: routes, the firewall, the access point, the
// DHCP and DNS server, and the engine.
//
// The shape of that request is the entire security of the split, and the design
// is blunt about it: "The privileged side accepts a short list of named actions
// and never a command built from anything the user typed. A privileged helper
// that takes a path and an argument list from its client is not a boundary; it
// is a way to run anything as root."
//
// So the interface below has a fixed, named set of methods, and no method
// takes a command, a
// path, an argument list, an interface name chosen freely, or any other string
// that the privileged side would hand to a shell or an exec. Every argument is
// a typed field on a struct declared here, and the privileged side is expected
// to validate each one against what it detected for itself rather than trusting
// it. The panel cannot express "run this"; it can only express "start", and the
// privileged side decides what starting means.
//
// The one field that carries free-form bytes is StartRequest.ConfigJSON, and
// that is deliberate and bounded: design section 6 requires the pasted config to
// be parsed and re-serialised rather than interpolated, which is exactly what
// internal/link does. What crosses the socket is a JSON document that
// internal/link built from parsed structures, never the text the user pasted.
//
// This package does not implement the privileged side. It defines the vocabulary
// and provides a fake (see fake.go) so the panel can be tested without root.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Action is the name of one privileged action. The set is closed: these are the
// only things the panel can ask for, and each one is exactly one method on
// Privileged.
//
// The strings exist for whoever writes the socket protocol on either side, so
// that the wire vocabulary and the Go vocabulary cannot drift apart.
// TestActionVocabularyMatchesTheInterface fails if a method is added without
// a name here.

	// way it was found, and then brings it up again from the saved settings.

	// repeatedly reached states that only a person with an SSH session could
	// clear. A created interface that outlived its start, an address flushed by
	// NetworkManager, a journal entry that survived a failed start. Every one
	// of those is recoverable by replaying what is already written down, and
	// none of them was reachable from the panel.
	//
	// It is deliberately NOT a reboot and it does not restart the two systemd
	// units. The point of this control is that a person holding only a phone
	// can press it: the panel and any SSH session stay up throughout, which a
