// LTR is a value that must not have its parts reordered by the bidirectional
// algorithm when it sits inside right-to-left text.
//
// This is the single most likely thing to go wrong in a Persian interface, and
// it goes wrong invisibly to whoever built it. An address, a subnet, a port, an
// interface name or a WiFi passphrase dropped into a Persian paragraph is laid
// out by the Unicode bidi algorithm along with everything around it, and the
// neutral characters in it, the dots, colons, slashes and hyphens, take their
// direction from their surroundings. "10.62.0.1/24" can come out as
// "24/10.62.0.1". The user then types what they see.
//
// So every one of them is a distinct Go type, and the template wraps every
// LTR-typed value in a bdi element. TestEveryIsolatedValueIsIsolated fills each
// LTR field in this struct with a sentinel by reflection, renders the page, and
// fails if any sentinel comes out unisolated. That is why the type exists
// rather than a naming convention: a new field of this type is covered by the
// test the moment it is added, and a new field of type string is not.
//
// bdi rather than a span with a dir attribute, and bdi with no dir on
// user-supplied names: bdi defaults to dir="auto", which takes the direction
// from the first strong character. For an address that is left-to-right, which
// is what is wanted; for a Persian network name that is right-to-left, which is
// also what is wanted. Forcing dir="ltr" on a name the user chose would reverse
// their own words. The technical values that can never be Persian are given an
// explicit dir="ltr" in the template anyway.

// pageData is what a template is given.

// Everything the template renders is a field on this struct. It does not reach
