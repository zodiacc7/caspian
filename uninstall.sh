Caspian-BYOC uninstaller.

Usage:
  uninstall.sh [--dry-run] [--purge | --keep-state] [--force] [--show-commands] [--yes]

  --dry-run        Print every action that would be taken, take none of them.
  --purge          Delete /var/lib/caspian, including the saved config.
  --keep-state     Keep /var/lib/caspian.
  --force          Carry on even if the network journal cannot be replayed.
  --show-commands  Print each replayed network command in full. These contain
                   network addresses, including the address of the proxy
                   server from the saved config, so the default is off.
  --yes, -y        Do not ask anything. With neither --purge nor --keep-state
                   this keeps the state, which is the safe answer.
  --help, -h       This text.

# --- replaying the network journal -----------------------------------------

# The journal at /var/lib/caspian/netcfg.journal holds the inverse of every
# network change the privileged service applied, written to disk as it went
# (design section 5.5). Replaying it in reverse is what returns the box to how
# it was found, and it has to work after a crash, which is exactly why the
# record is on disk rather than in the process that made it.
#
# The replay refuses to run anything outside the allowlist in
# internal/netcfg/command.go: ip, iw, nft, sysctl, nmcli. That allowlist exists so
# that the privileged side never runs a command built from user input, and the
# same reasoning applies with more force here, where the input is a file that
# has been sitting on disk.
#
# The parsing and the execution are done by python3 rather than by this shell.
# The journal entries are JSON objects (the shape of netcfg.Command: path,
# args, stdin, why), a shell cannot parse JSON without help, and the argument
# vector must reach execve without passing through a shell at any point.

# Replays a Caspian-BYOC network journal.
#
# The format is the one internal/netcfg/journal.go writes: JSON lines, one
# Record per line, several records per step, keyed by "seq".
#
#   {"seq":1,"phase":"begin","t":"...","op":"route","why":"...",
#    "do":{"path":"ip","args":[...]},"undo":{"path":"ip","args":[...]}}
#   {"seq":1,"phase":"done","t":"..."}
#
# The rules below are taken from LoadJournal and Entry.NeedsUndo in that file,
# and any change there has to be mirrored here:
#
#   - the "begin" record carries op, why, do and undo; later records for the
#     same seq only move the phase on
#   - an entry needs undoing unless its last phase is "undone"; "begin",
#     "done" and "failed" all still need it, because a command that was killed
#     halfway can have landed part of its effect
#   - an entry with neither a do nor an undo is dropped
#   - inverses are replayed newest first
